python run.py --setup-portfolio
```
Interactive wizard will guide you through creating a portfolio with trading capital and initial holdings.

#### Portfolio Commands
```bash
# Show portfolio details
python run.py --show-portfolio

# List all portfolios
python run.py --list-portfolios

# Update trading capital
python run.py --update-capital 10000

# Add/update holdings
python run.py --add-holding AAPL 100 --cost 150.00

# Remove holdings
python run.py --remove-holding AAPL

# Record manual trades
python run.py --record-trade AAPL BUY 50 155.00 --strategy technical --confidence 0.75

# Backup database
python run.py --backup --output backups/portfolio_backup.db

# Restore from backup
python run.py --restore backups/portfolio_backup.db

# Analyze entire portfolio
python run.py --analyze-portfolio

# Analyze specific portfolio
python run.py --analyze-portfolio --portfolio my_portfolio
```

### Scheduled Trading Bot

`bot.py` scans a watchlist while the market is open. It is a dry run by
default: it analyzes and logs, and places no orders.

```bash
# Dry run every 15 minutes
python bot.py --symbols AAPL,MSFT,NVDA

# Trade on Alpaca paper with risk limits from .env
python bot.py --symbols AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --portfolio default --execute

# One cycle and exit (for cron)
python bot.py --once --execute
```

#### ML strategy (default for the bot)

The bot scores each symbol with a model that combines candlestick/trend
technicals with news sentiment, then hands actionable signals to the same
executor and risk manager as everything else:

```
bars (Alpaca/Yahoo) -> core/features.py ─┐
news (Alpaca News)  -> core/news_sentiment.py ─┤-> core/ml_strategy.py -> core/ml_signal_engine.py
                                                         -> TradingWorkflow -> RiskManager -> bracket order
```

- **Features** (`core/features.py`): candle body ratio `(C-O)/(H-L)`, upper and
  lower wick ratios, gap %, EMA 20/50/200 spreads and slope, RSI, MACD, ATR,
  trailing returns and volume z-score. All causal: a row only uses bars up
  to that candle's close, and the still-forming bar is dropped.
- **Sentiment** (`core/news_sentiment.py`): Alpaca News headlines scored with
  FinBERT (`pip install -r requirements-ml.txt`) or a built-in lexicon
  fallback, aggregated into a 24-hour time-decayed score in [-1, +1].
  If news is unavailable, the model gets "missing" and keeps working on
  technicals alone.
- **Model** (`core/ml_strategy.py`): LightGBM in a scikit-learn pipeline
  predicts P(ATR take-profit is hit before the ATR stop). BUY at or above
  `ML_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`; SELL (exit a held position) only when P is at
  or below half the training base rate (`ML_EXIT_THRESHOLD`), since target
  hits are rare by design and a low P usually means "no edge", not
  "bearish"; otherwise HOLD. With no trained model it falls back to a
  trend/momentum/sentiment heuristic (`mode=heuristic` in the logs).
- **Sizing and stops**: risk `RISK_PER_TRADE_PCT` of capital between entry
  and a `ATR_STOP_MULT` x ATR stop; target at `ATR_TARGET_MULT` x ATR. Both
  are re-centred on the live price at order time and then subject to every
  risk check below.

Train a model (writes `models/ml_signal.joblib`):

```bash
python scripts/train_model.py --symbols AAPL,MSFT,NVDA,AMD,SPY --days 365
python scripts/train_model.py --no-news --timeframe 1Day --days 1500   # technicals only
python scripts/train_model.py --synthetic                              # offline demo
```

The script labels each bar by whether price hit the take-profit before the
stop within `--horizon` bars, holds out the most recent 20% (with a purge
gap so no training label sees test prices), and prints AUC, base rate, and
win rate / approximate expectancy at your threshold. **If AUC is near 0.5 or
expectancy is negative, the model has no edge: keep the bot in dry-run.**
Retrain after changing `ATR_*_MULT`, the timeframe, or the feature code.
Use `--strategy classic` to run the original rule-based pipeline.

#### Backtesting

`scripts/backtest.py` replays the whole path on history using the live code:
the same features, `MLStrategy` decisions, risk-per-trade sizing and
`RiskManager` checks (with a simulated account), with realistic execution:

- Decide at a bar's close; fill at the **next** bar's open plus slippage.
- Brackets at the signal's ATR distances around the fill price; a gap through
  a level fills at the open, and a bar touching both counts as the stop.
- Intraday: decisions only while the market is open; brackets only trigger in
  bars overlapping the regular session. Queued orders reserve buying power.

```bash
# Walk-forward (default): train on the first 60%, trade only the unseen 40%
python scripts/backtest.py --symbols AAPL,MSFT,NVDA,AMD,SPY --days 730

# Add news sentiment, write trades.csv / equity.csv / summary.json
python scripts/backtest.py --news --out reports/bt

# A saved model (warns if the test period overlaps its training data)
python scripts/backtest.py --mode model

# The no-model heuristic, or an offline demo
python scripts/backtest.py --mode heuristic --timeframe 1Day --days 1500
python scripts/backtest.py --synthetic
```

The report shows return vs. equal-weight buy-and-hold, max drawdown, daily
Sharpe, trade count, win rate, average R, profit factor, exit reasons, how
often each risk limit blocked an entry, and how many BUY-level signals fell
outside market hours. Walk-forward runs also print a **threshold audit** for
the unseen period (hit rate and approximate expectancy at each
`ML_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`, plus a calibration table), saved as
`threshold_sweep.csv` / `calibration.csv` with `--out`. Treat fewer than ~30 trades as
inconclusive, and only use `--execute` if the walk-forward result beats
buy-and-hold with positive average R after slippage.

Every order, whether from the bot, the CLI (`--paper-trade`), the API or
the dashboard, goes through the same safeguards:

- **Bracket orders**: each BUY is sent with a broker-side stop-loss and
  take-profit, so the position is protected even if the bot stops running.
  The strategy's ATR-based levels are used when they fit the live price,
  otherwise `STOP_LOSS_PCT` / `TAKE_PROFIT_PCT`.
- **Risk checks** (`core/risk_manager.py`): kill switch (`TRADING_ENABLED`),
  daily loss limit (`MAX_DAILY_LOSS_PCT`), daily entry limit
  (`MAX_DAILY_TRADES`), per-symbol position cap (`MAX_PORTFOLIO_ALLOCATION`
  of equity), buying power, and `MIN_PRICE`. Orders are shrunk to fit, never
  enlarged. Exits are allowed even after the loss limit trips.
- **No orders while the market is closed**, and sells never exceed the shares
  held (no accidental shorts).
